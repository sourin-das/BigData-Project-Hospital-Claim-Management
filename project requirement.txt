5. SQOOP
6. HIVE
7. Python analytics packages

Steps

1. Get external source file
2. Place all ext source file in UNIX
3. Load all source file from UNIX to MYSQL by appyling minimal data quality rules
4. Apply transformation rules using Python and Load data into hive tables
5. Same Data should move to HDFS by Sqoop
6. Build analytical graph from Hive tables


Modules:
